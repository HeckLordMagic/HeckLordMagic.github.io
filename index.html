  				<h5>How COVID-19 impacted my life in both positive and negative ways</h5>
  				<h6>Written by HeckLordMagic on Thursday the 1st of July, 2021</h6>
  				<p> 
  				COVID-19 is both good and bad. Today I will share my personal experiences on the whole pandemic.
  				</p>

<b>The good</b>
<p>
One of the best things was the lockdown. It gave me a lot of free time when I learnt to code. Online school started though only a few teachers adapted to it. We got a classroom in May. I was the leader of my schedule, something I could not say about 
IRL school. For a whole month I didn't go outside. Not even in my backyard.
</p>
<b>The bad</b>
<p>
Social distancing and masks suck. I almost choked on one. Seeing how many people we're being infected, it was very worrying. I even got COVID. It sucked that I had to stay in my room quarantined. And at that time I was moving houses. 

</p>			
<b>In conclusion, COVID SUCKED.</b> Thanks for reading I guess.</blockquote>
